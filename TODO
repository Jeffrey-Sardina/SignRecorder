Important
    Expose overwrite warnings!
    Dynamic file loading
    Allow display of various stimuli:
        videos
        images
        text
    Time recording
        Start once stimulus has been completely shown (eg. after video)
        Stop on button release
        Before this comes a stimulus of fixed and known length; after comes the video this records; thus total time is known (but I do not need that)
    Write to <video_name>.meta files containing video data such as timing (see above)
    Allow merging of videos
    Allow search for more webcams after Start
