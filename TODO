Important
    Expose overwrite warnings!
    waitKey stuff
General
    Dynamic file loading
    Allow display of various stimuli:
        videos
        images
        text
    Time recording
        Start once stimulus has been completely shown (eg. after video)
        Stop on button release
        Before this comes a stimulus of fixed and known length; after comes the video this records; thus total time is known (but I do not need that)
    Write to <video_name>.meta files containing video data such as timing (see above)
    Allow search for more webcams after Start
    Actually use all the data loaded from the config file.

Discussion
    Experimental organization
    Naming conventions

Long-term / potential (ask lab)
    Create / edit experiments from within the program
    Output other file formats by user choice
    Connect to ELAN API? (Does it even have one I can use?)
    Allow merging of videos
    Config file recovery if deleted

Timing
    I want to be on v. 0.2 (with video, image, or text stimuli and .meta records of timing) by Monday, Feb. 11
