v. 0.0 to 0.2alpha
    User-side:
        Complete UI revamp. The program now runs maximized and uses a more clear dark theme
        UI is now branched into three sections--an info menu, a section to create experiments, and a section to load created experiments.
        Experiments can be created, and the result is a .csv formatted file that can be loaded at a later time to run the experiment in the recorder
        Stimuli can not be images, video, or text--but the display of those is a bit unpolished
    
    Dev-side:
        Removes a whole host of code: the Subject class and the old UI loading methods
        Moved to a OO class-based approach for the UI
        Code is now a .pyw so it does not create a terminal
        Settings class added, which links to and loads from a config file
        Logging to disk through the python logging utilities implemented
        Dependency list added (renamed to requirements so GitHub would recognize it)
        setup.py script added with dependency opencv-python listed
    
    Notes:
        This version is an alpha. It is quite a bit unstable, but core functionality is leaps and bounds ahead of 0.1.
            See 'Known Bugs' for more details
        Please be wary about editing the config file. There is no way to restore it yet!
        Feel free to disregard the build folder--I think I may move away from trying to compile the program. Not sure yet--that will be made clear in a later version.

v. 0.0 to 0.1
    User-side:
        Edited the About tab to contain all the data that used to be in "Credits"
        Expanded the UI view for the About tab and reduced it for the Controls tab
        Edited Controls descriptions to be more concise

    Dev-side:
        Removed old, unused code and variables
        Added a few comments
        Replaced calls to exit() with calls to sys.exit() for compatibility with older Python 3.x versions
