v. 0.2beta to 0.2.1beta
    User-side:
        Updates how the space bar works for recording based on specifications
        Now runs reliably on MAC the way it does on windows
        Minor bug fixes and test file edits

v. 0.2alpha to 0.2beta
    User-side:
        Added a 'Show Stimuli' page in which stimuli are showed within the same window
        Many, many bug fixes that make this version semi-stable, and much more reliable than the alpha
        Program stops properly on finishing recording data
        Program quits and closes resources properly on exit (but not force-quit)
        Files chosen can been seen once they are selected in the Create Experiment page
        Support for text-stimuli removed due to lack of anticipated use
        Updated the UI to be based on text boxes, not labels
        Made UI element sizing more consistent
        Removed the UI bug in which non-current pages were still rendered
    
    Dev-side:
        Code cleaned up, with unneeded references removed
        Addition dependency PIL (Pillow) added to do rendering of images in tkinter
        Significantly better logging that is actually helpful,in finding errors
        webcam_num now defaults to 1, which makes much more sense
        Webcam searching never run, but the function remains

    Notes:
        Being a beta, this program is fairly stable but still not ready for complete use in a production environment.
        Testing has been light and mostly for non-edge cases
        Timeline for 0.2stable unknown as of yet, as it largely depends on the number of bugs found in testing the beta
        config.csv, if corrupted, should not stop the program from running

v. 0.1 to 0.2alpha
    User-side:
        Complete UI revamp. The program now runs maximized and uses a more clear dark theme
        UI is now branched into three sections--an info menu, a section to create experiments, and a section to load created experiments.
        Experiments can be created, and the result is a .csv formatted file that can be loaded at a later time to run the experiment in the recorder
        Stimuli can not be images, video, or text--but the display of those is a bit unpolished
    
    Dev-side:
        Removes a whole host of code: the Subject class and the old UI loading methods
        Moved to an OO class-based approach for the UI
        Code is now a .pyw so it does not create a terminal
        Settings class added, which links to and loads from a config file
        Logging to disk through the python logging utilities implemented
        Dependency list added (renamed to requirements so GitHub would recognize it)
        setup.py script added with dependency OpenCV-python listed
    
    Notes:
        This version is an alpha. It is quite a bit unstable, but core functionality is leaps and bounds ahead of 0.1.
            See 'Known Bugs' for more details
        Please be wary about editing the config file. There is no way to restore it yet!
        Feel free to disregard the build folder--I think I may move away from trying to compile the program. Not sure yet--that will be made clear in a later version.

v. 0.0 to 0.1
    User-side:
        Edited the About tab to contain all the data that used to be in "Credits"
        Expanded the UI view for the About tab and reduced it for the Controls tab
        Edited Controls descriptions to be more concise

    Dev-side:
        Removed old, unused code and variables
        Added a few comments
        Replaced calls to exit() with calls to sys.exit() for compatibility with older Python 3.x versions
